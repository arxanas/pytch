How does Pytch work?
--------------------

Pytch is a compiler that runs on ``.pytch`` files in your project directory.

Each individual Pytch module is compiled down to a single Python module in
the same directory. These Python files are then available to the rest of your
project, just as if you had written the module in Python to begin with.

If you decide that you don't want to use Pytch anymore, then you can just
delete the source Pytch files and keep the produced Python files!
