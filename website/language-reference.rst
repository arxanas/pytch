Language Reference
==================

This is the language reference guide for the Pytch programming language. The
structure of Pytch's language reference guide is based on `Python's language
reference <https://docs.python.org/3/>`__.

The language reference is very new, so if you find any issues in this
documentation, please file a documentation bug on the `issue tracker
<https://github.com/arxanas/pytch/issues/new/choose>`__. These are some
examples of helpful issues to raise:

  * Typos.
  * Minor rewordings.
  * Missing topics.
  * Clarification questions for topics not adequately addressed.

.. note::

   To file an issue on the issue tracker, please hover over the relevant heading
   in the documentation so that the "Â¶" link appears, and copy the link's URL
   into your issue. This way, I can quickly find the part of the documentation
   that you're referring to.
