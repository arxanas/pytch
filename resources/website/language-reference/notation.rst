Notation
--------

The notation used in the language reference is the same as `Python 3's EBNF
notation <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#notation>`__.

In :doc:`lexical-analysis`, EBNF is used indicate sequences of characters,
while in the remainder of the documentation, EBNF is used to indicate
sequences of tokens.

Whitespace is typically implicit in these EBNF descriptions.
