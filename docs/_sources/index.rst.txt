Pytch --- tooling-focused Python
================================

Pytch is an expression-oriented, tooling-focused language that compiles down
to Python.

Why Pytch?
----------

Python is a great language for prototyping, but development speed can start
to slow down as your project grows in size. You can incrementally adopt Pytch
into your existing Python projects to start getting high-quality IDE support.
